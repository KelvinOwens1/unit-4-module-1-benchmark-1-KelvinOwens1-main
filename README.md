# Module 1: Request -> Response Benchmark

### Benchmark

For this benchmark, you will create a django project (and app) with a few codingbat challenge style views that accept string or numeric information from the path. You will also be required to write test cases for these views.
For each of the paths bases below, implement the corresponding codingbat challenge as a view. Arguments should be collected from the path and the response should contain the answer to the challenge. Additionally, you should implement three of the test cases that coding bat provides as test cases in your django app.

1. [ ] `string-2/count-hi/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
2. [ ] `warmup-2/string-match/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
3. [ ] `logic-2/round-sum/...` implemented with 3 test cases.
